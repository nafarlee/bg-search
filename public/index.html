  <h2>Language</h2>

  <p>A valid query in this language is comprised of any number of terms, combined or modified in certain ways. All
    terms may be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Separated by spaces for an <strong>AND</strong> relationship</li>
    <li>Separated by the word "or" for an <strong>OR</strong> relationship</li>
    <li>Grouped together by surrounding one or more with parentheses. This is useful in conjunction with the "or"
      separator.</li>
    <li>Prefixed with a minus (-) to <strong>NEGATE</strong> the terms results</li>
  </ul>

  <div>
    <pre><code>-is:expansion (mechanic:"Dice Rolling" best-players=2) or (category:economic best-players=4)</code></pre>
    <p>For example, the above query would match any games, which are <strong>not expansions</strong>, and are
      <strong>either dice rolling</strong> games that play <strong>best with 2 players</strong>, <strong>or</strong>
      are <strong>economic games</strong> that play <strong>best with 4 players</strong></p>
    <p>Most terms have shortcuts, so if you like saving time, the above query could also be written as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>-is:e (m:"Dice Rolling" bp=2) or (c:economic bp=4)</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>There are also some behaviours that are specific to the type of the term:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Most terms are separated by a colon (:), and can use quotes to specify values that contain spaces.  Eg.
      <code>name:"Race for the Galaxy"</code></li>
    <li>Terms that work with numbers can use <strong>=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, or &lt;=</strong> to specify relationships.
      Eg. <code>average-rating&gt;=7.5</code>
      <li>Some terms always start with <strong>is</strong>, and are always separated by a <strong>colon (:)</strong>, but
        otherwise are only allowed to have specific values.  Eg. <code>is:expansion</code>
  </ul>
